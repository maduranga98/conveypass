# ConvoyPass operations runbook

Everything an operator needs for staging and production. Commands assume the repository root, the Firebase CLI
(`npm i -g firebase-tools` or `npx firebase-tools`) and `gcloud` signed in to the right project. Replace
`PROJECT` with the project id (`staging` / `prod` aliases are in `.firebaserc`) and `LOCATION` with the Firestore
location (`asia-south2` in `firebase.json`).

> **What is tested and what is not.** The code, rules, CI and the emulator-based drills below are tested in this
> repository. The `gcloud` and console steps (backups, restore, TTL, App Check, budgets, uptime) touch a real
> Google Cloud project and can only be proven there: each has an expected result and a sign-off box so the first
> person who runs it in staging can record that it worked.

## Environments

| Alias | Project | Used for | Deployed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| (emulators) | `demo-conveypass-*` | local work, tests, e2e | `npm run emulators` |
| `staging` | `.firebaserc` `projects.staging` | pre-production, restore drills, App Check monitoring | pushing a `v*` tag (automatic) |
| `prod` | `.firebaserc` `projects.prod` | live | the same tag, after a manual approval |

`.firebaserc` ships with `REPLACE-ME-…` placeholders: put the real project ids in before the first deploy. The scripts
refuse to run against a placeholder.

Per-environment function settings live in `functions/.env.<alias>` (the deploy writes them from GitHub environment
variables; locally copy `functions/.env.example`):

| Variable | Meaning | Staging | Production |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FUNCTIONS_REGION` | region of every callable (must equal `VITE_FUNCTIONS_REGION`) | `asia-south1` | `asia-south1` |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | public https origin (push links) | staging URL | production URL |
| `ENFORCE_APP_CHECK` | reject callables without an App Check token | `false`, then `true` | `false`, then `true` |
| `MIN_INSTANCES` | warm instances for `checkIn`, `resolveVehicle`, `submitPass` | `0` | `1` |
| `RATE_LIMIT_CALLS`, `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | per-user limit on sensitive callables | `30` / `60` | `30` / `60` |
| `FIRESTORE_TRIGGER_REGION` | only if the deploy rejects the trigger region (see below) | – | – |
| `PIN_IP_FAILURES`, `PIN_DEVICE_FAILURES`, `PIN_WINDOW_MINUTES`, `PIN_LOCK_MINUTES`, `PIN_LOCK_MAX_MINUTES`, `PIN_PROBE_FAILURES`, `PIN_PROBE_WINDOW_MINUTES` | PIN sign-in throttling ([below](#pin-sign-in-drivers-and-security)); optional, the defaults apply | – | – |

The **`PIN_PEPPER` secret** is not in these files: it lives in Secret Manager ([PIN sign-in](#pin-sign-in-drivers-and-security)).

**First deploy of a new project**

1. Blaze plan (scheduled functions need Cloud Scheduler and Pub/Sub; Storage rules and functions need it too).
2. Enable APIs: Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, Eventarc, Cloud Scheduler, Pub/Sub, Firebase Cloud Messaging.
3. Storage rules read Firestore (`firestore.get`): the first deploy asks to grant the cross-service role. Say yes
   (`gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT --member=serviceAccount:service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-firebasestorage.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role=roles/firebaserules.firestoreServiceAgent` if it is skipped).
4. Firestore triggers (`onPassWritten`, `onGateEventCreated`) are deployed in `FUNCTIONS_REGION` by default. If Firebase
   rejects that region because the database lives elsewhere (`asia-south2`), set `FIRESTORE_TRIGGER_REGION=asia-south2`
   in `functions/.env.<alias>`.
5. `hosting` rewrites `/csp-report` to the `cspReport` function in region `asia-south1`: change the region in `firebase.json` if you use another.
6. Set the `PIN_PEPPER` secret **before** the first functions deploy ([PIN sign-in](#pin-sign-in-drivers-and-security)), and
   give the functions' runtime service account the *Service Account Token Creator* role on itself (`loginWithPin`
   signs custom tokens).
7. Create the first tenant ([below](#tenants-and-admins)), then do the console steps in this document (TTL, backups, budget, uptime, App Check).

## Deploy

**Normal release.** Merge to the main branch, then tag:

```sh
git tag v1.4.0 && git push origin v1.4.0
```

`deploy.yml` runs the same checks as CI (`ci.yml`), then deploys **staging** automatically, then waits for approval
before **production** (the GitHub environment `production` with *Required reviewers*). Within each environment the
order is fixed, so the web app never meets an older backend:

1. Firestore rules, indexes and Storage rules (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage`)
2. Functions (`--only functions`; predeploy builds `functions/`)
3. Hosting (`--only hosting`, after `npm run build` with the environment's public `VITE_*` values)

New composite indexes build in the background; a query that needs one fails until it is ready (`firebase firestore:indexes` or the console shows progress). Check before approving production.

**Manual deploy** (break glass; same order): `npm run build` then
`npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage --project prod`, then `--only functions`, then `--only hosting`.

**Verifying a release** (staging, before approving production): sign in as each role, submit a pass as a driver, watch the supervisor's bell, approve through both steps, check in at the gate, open `/admin/audit`.

## Rollback

| What | How |
|---|---|
| **Hosting** (instant) | Console > Hosting > Release history > the previous version > *Rollback*. CLI: `firebase hosting:clone PROJECT@VERSION_ID PROJECT:live --project prod` (version ids from `firebase hosting:releases:list`). Installed PWAs fetch the restored shell on their next start (the service worker updates itself). |
| **Functions** | Redeploy the previous tag: `git checkout v1.3.2 && npx firebase deploy --only functions --project prod`. For an instant switch, route traffic to the previous Cloud Run revision: `gcloud run services update-traffic FUNCTION_NAME_LOWERCASE --to-revisions=REVISION=100 --region asia-south1`. Callable names are lowercase Cloud Run services. |
| **Rules** | `git checkout v1.3.2 -- firestore.rules storage.rules && npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage --project prod` |
| **Indexes** | Indexes are only added by deploys. Leave them: unused indexes are harmless. |
| **A bad data change** | Do not edit by hand: [restore](#backups-and-restore). |

Roll **back hosting and functions together** when a release changed a callable's input or output: the web app of version N only talks to functions of version N or N+1 (callables are additive by convention).

## PIN sign-in (drivers and security)

Drivers and security guards sign in by typing **one 8-digit PIN** at `/login` (Module 12). Office staff (admin, officer,
supervisor) and the Super admin keep email and password at `/login/staff`. A PIN is generated by the server, shown once
on the PIN card, and never stored: `pinIndex/{HMAC-SHA256(pin, PIN_PEPPER)}` maps it to the user. Their Auth users have
no email and no password; `loginWithPin` returns a custom token.

### The `PIN_PEPPER` secret

32+ random bytes in Secret Manager. Every PIN, device id and IP is hashed with it.

```sh
# staging (repeat with --project <prod-id> for production; use a DIFFERENT value per environment)
openssl rand -base64 48                                                # copy the output
npx firebase functions:secrets:set PIN_PEPPER --project <staging-id>   # paste it at the prompt (not echoed, not in shell history)
npx firebase functions:secrets:get PIN_PEPPER --project <staging-id>   # lists versions, never the value
npx firebase deploy --only functions --project <staging-id>            # functions pick up the latest version on deploy
```

(Scripted alternative: `openssl rand -base64 48 > /tmp/p && npx firebase functions:secrets:set PIN_PEPPER --project <id> --data-file /tmp/p && shred -u /tmp/p`.)

The deploy binds `createUser`, `reissuePin` and `loginWithPin` to the secret. Without it they refuse
(`config-missing`), and every PIN sign-in fails with the generic message (a structured error is logged).

**Emulator:** put `PIN_PEPPER=<32+ characters>` in `functions/.secret.local` (git-ignored). Without that file the
emulator functions fall back to a fixed development pepper, which `seed:demo`, the e2e setup and the scripts use too.
A deployed function never falls back.

**Rotating the pepper invalidates every PIN at once**: no stored HMAC matches any more, so every driver and guard is
locked out until they get a new PIN. Only rotate after a suspected leak of the secret, then reissue every PIN (the
migration script does it in bulk: delete the tenant's `pinIndex` docs, set the users' `loginType` to `password`, run
`migrate:pin-login`). Throttle counters and known-device lists reset too (they are keyed by the same HMAC).

### Lost PIN

*Users* (admin) or *Drivers* (admin; supervisors for their own drivers) > **Reissue PIN** > confirm. The old PIN stops
working at once, the person is signed out on every phone, and the new PIN card is shown once (Copy, WhatsApp, Print
card). PINs are never viewable later: if a card is lost, reissue again.

### Sessions

PIN sessions persist on the phone up to a server-enforced maximum from the sign-in time: **drivers 90 days, security
16 hours** (`src/lib/session.ts` and `functions/src/session.ts`, keep both in sync). After that, or after a reissue, the
callables answer `session-expired` and the app asks for the PIN again, returning to the page the person was on.

### Throttling and limits

Before any lookup, `loginWithPin` checks `pinAttempts/ip-<hmac>` and `pinAttempts/dev-<hmac>`:
**10 failures per 15 minutes per IP, 8 per 15 minutes per device**, then a 15-minute lock that doubles for repeat lockouts
(within 24 hours) up to 2 hours. A successful sign-in never resets the IP counter (carrier IPs are shared); it clears the
device's failures. Every failure (wrong, unknown, disabled, suspended, malformed, throttled) is the same error after at
least 400 ms (+ up to 150 ms jitter); a locked one adds `retryAfterSeconds`. There is **no global lockout** by design.

The limits are in `PIN_LIMITS` (`functions/src/config.ts`) and can be overridden in `functions/.env.<alias>`; the
overrides only make them stricter (fewer failures, longer windows and locks), a looser value is clamped back.

### `security.pin_probe_suspected`

When failures across the whole platform reach `PIN_PROBE_FAILURES` (default 200) in `PIN_PROBE_WINDOW_MINUTES` (5),
one `platformAuditLog/pinprobe_<windowStart>` entry is written and an ERROR log line with
`reason: "pin-probe-suspected"` is emitted (alert on it in Cloud Logging). To investigate:

1. Logs Explorer: `jsonPayload.fn="loginWithPin" AND jsonPayload.outcome=("denied" OR "rate-limited")` around the
   window: volume over time, and how many are `rate-limited` (locked IPs/devices). No PIN, device id or IP is logged.
2. `pinAttempts` in the console (hashed keys only): many `ip-…` docs with lockouts = a distributed attempt; one key with
   repeated lockouts = a single source.
3. Cloud Armor / App Check metrics: enforce App Check (`ENFORCE_APP_CHECK=true`) if it is not yet; consider a temporary
   Cloud Armor rate rule in front of hosting if traffic is extreme.
4. If a PIN may have been guessed, reissue it (the person's `auditLog` shows `auth.pin_login` with the hashed device and
   whether it was new; admins also get "signed in on a new device" for security users).

### Moving existing drivers and security to PINs

```sh
npm run migrate:pin-login -- --env staging                                       # dry run: who would move
PIN_PEPPER="$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=PIN_PEPPER --project <staging-id>)" \
  npm run migrate:pin-login -- --env staging --apply --out ~/convoypass-staging-pins.csv
```

Same uid and claims; the Auth user is recreated without email or password (disabled accounts stay disabled); one
`pinIndex` doc and one `user.migratePinLogin` audit entry per person. The CSV (name, role, company, PIN) is created with
mode 0600, refuses a path inside the repository and never overwrites. **Deliver the PINs privately, then delete the file.**
Production: `--env prod --confirm-prod` plus the project id typed back (or `--confirm-project <id>`). Re-running skips
accounts already on PINs. A single person can also be moved by **Reissue PIN** in the app.

### TTL for throttle counters

```sh
gcloud firestore fields ttls update expireAt --collection-group=pinAttempts --enable-ttl --database='(default)' --project=PROJECT
```

## Tenants and admins

Two ways to create a workspace. **Use the invite link for real clients**; `create-tenant` is for operators who must set
a client up themselves (and for the emulator). Both go through `provisionTenant` (`functions/src/tenants/tenantDefaults.ts`),
so a tenant made either way has the same defaults (checklist, rejection reasons, one gate, SLA 30/30, pass settings,
timezone, evidence retention off).

### Super admin and the Super admin console

The **Super admin** is the person who runs ConvoyPass itself. They are not a member of any client's workspace. Their console
is `/platform` ("Super admin console"). Internally the account is still called an operator (`role: 'platform'`,
`platformAdmin`, `operators/{uid}`, `platformAuditLog`).

- Claims `{ role: 'platform', platformAdmin: true }` and **no `tenantId`**, set only by `npm run superadmin:create`
  (`operator:create` is an alias). No signup, callable or screen can create or promote a super admin. Profile
  `operators/{uid}` (name, email, createdAt, `status`); no `users` doc.
- Every tenant rule and Storage rule needs a `tenantId`, so a super admin is denied all workspace data (passes, vehicles,
  drivers, photos, gate events, notifications). The console shows workspace names, admins and **counts** only.
- **One or two accounts, on company mailboxes** (not personal ones), each with a **strong, unique password** (14+ characters,
  a password manager). Full runbook (bootstrap, doctor, recovery, MFA, checklist): **`docs/superadmin.md`**. **Enable MFA through Identity Platform before onboarding the first paying client** (Firebase console >
  Authentication > Sign-in method > Multi-factor authentication): this account can create workspaces and admins.
- Mutating calls (create or reset anything, disable, revoke) need a sign-in from the last 15 minutes; the console asks for the
  password again and retries once (or hands over to `/platform/login`, which returns to the same page). Changing the own
  password needs 5 minutes. A temporary password forces `/platform/change-password`; 30 idle minutes sign the account out. Reads work with an older login. Every call needs a verified email (the script verifies it) and
  an `active` `operators/{uid}`, and is rate limited (30 a minute per function).
- Every action is written to `platformAuditLog` (actor, action, hash prefix or tenant id; never a code, a password or a full
  hash) **and**, for anything touching a workspace's admins, to that tenant's own `auditLog` (actor role `superadmin`, name
  "ConvoyPass Super Admin"), so the company's admins can see who created or changed their admin accounts in Audit log. The scripts
  write `actorUid: 'script'`. No client can read `platformAuditLog`: use the Firebase console.

```sh
npm run superadmin:create -- --env staging --email olive@convoypass.com --name "Olive"          # password generated, printed once
npm run superadmin:create -- --env prod --confirm-prod --email olive@convoypass.com --name "Olive"   # also asks you to type the project id
npm run superadmin:doctor -- --env prod --confirm-prod --email olive@convoypass.com [--fix]
npm run superadmin:disable -- --env prod --confirm-prod --email olive@convoypass.com            # disables, revokes tokens, marks the doc
```

Every script needs `--env` (no default); production also needs the project id typed back, or `--confirm-project <id>` in CI.
There is no `--password` argument: the password is generated (20 characters, printed once) or piped in with `--password-stdin`
(14+ characters, not common, not the email). An existing account is never touched without `--repair` or `--reset-password`, and an
email that belongs to a tenant user is refused. After writing, the script reads the account back and prints a PASS/FAIL table.

**Locked-out super admin.** `npm run superadmin:create -- --env prod --confirm-prod --email … --reset-password` prints a new
temporary password once and signs every session out; `superadmin:doctor --fix` (or `--repair`) fixes broken claims or profile.
Lost your machine: run the same commands from Google Cloud Shell. Compromise: `superadmin:disable`, review `platformAuditLog`, create
a new account on a different mailbox. Details: `docs/superadmin.md`.

### Onboarding a new client

**Normal route: Super admin console > New workspace.** Sign in at `/platform/login` with the super admin account; you
land on `/platform`.

1. **Workspaces > New workspace.** Company name, timezone (search; default Asia/Colombo), admin name and admin email. The server
   needs `APP_BASE_URL` (https; `functions/.env.<alias>`) for the login URL. The email must not belong to any existing account.
2. **Hand over the credentials.** The one-time card shows the login URL, the admin email and a **temporary password** (16
   characters, masked until *Show*), with *Copy* for each, *Copy all as message*, *Send by WhatsApp* and *Send by email*. The
   password is shown **once**; the card closes only with *I've shared it*, and the password is then gone from the browser. A lost
   password cannot be shown again: use *Reset credentials* on the workspace page.
3. **What the admin sees.** They sign in with the temporary password, are forced to choose a new one (10+ characters, not
   common), and land on the dashboard with the "Get ConvoyPass ready" checklist. The workspace page shows "Not signed in yet"
   until they do.
4. **Manage admins** on the workspace page: *Add admin* (another temporary password, same card), *Edit name*, *Reset credentials*
   (new temporary password, change forced, sessions revoked) and *Disable / Enable* (a disabled admin is signed out; **the last
   active admin of a workspace cannot be disabled**). Tenant admins cannot do any of this themselves: their Users page shows admin
   accounts as "Managed by ConvoyPass", and the functions refuse.
5. **After setup** the client adds their own contractors, supervisors, officers, security users, vehicles and drivers.

**Alternative: an invite link**, when the client should choose their own password. *Invites > New invite* (company hint,
optional expected admin email that locks the invite, expiry 1 to 30 days); the link is shown once with Copy, WhatsApp and email.
It creates one workspace and its first admin (Module 8 flow). Track and revoke invites on the same page: `unused`, `claimed`
(someone is mid-setup, up to 10 minutes), `used` (with the workspace name), `expired`; a used or claimed invite cannot be
revoked. A wrong, expired, used, claimed or wrongly-locked link all show "This setup link is invalid or has expired."

**Fallback: scripts** (the console is down). They write the same invites and also add `platformAuditLog` entries. Prerequisites:
`APP_BASE_URL` (https) and Application Default Credentials for the project.

```sh
npm run invite:create -- --env staging --company "Acme Quarry" --lock-email ops@acme.example --expires-days 7
npm run invite:create -- --env prod --confirm-prod --company "Acme Quarry" --lock-email ops@acme.example
npm run invite:list -- --env prod --confirm-prod
npm run invite:revoke -- --env prod --confirm-prod 1a2b3c4d
```

The script prints the link **once**; send it over a secure channel. A used invite is a record of the tenant it created and cannot
be deleted. If setup fails halfway (for example the email already has an account), nothing is left behind and the same link works again.

Operator fallback (no link; you choose the email and a temporary password, and the admin must change it at first login):

```sh
npm run create-tenant -- --env staging --tenant-name "Acme Quarry" --email admin@acme.example [--timezone Asia/Colombo] [--tenant-id acme]   # temporary password generated, printed once
pass show acme-admin | npm run create-tenant -- --env prod --confirm-prod --confirm-project <prod-project-id> --tenant-name "Acme Quarry" --email admin@acme.example --password-stdin
```

Without `--tenant-id` the tenant id is `ten_` + 10 random characters.

### Admin locked out

1. **Email reset first.** The admin opens *Sign in > Forgot password?* and follows the emailed link. This only works if the
   mailbox is theirs and the email is correct (a verified email is best: staff see a banner until they verify).
2. **Operator recovery** when that fails (mailbox gone, email typo):

   ```sh
   # a reset link they open themselves (shown once; send it securely)
   npm run admin:reset -- --env prod --confirm-prod --email admin@acme.example --link
   # or a random temporary password (shown once; all sessions are signed out; they must choose a new one at login)
   npm run admin:reset -- --env prod --confirm-prod --email admin@acme.example --temp-password
   ```

   It checks the user exists and is an admin in Firestore (it will not touch any other role: for those an admin uses
   *Users > Reset credential*), and writes an `admin.recovery` audit entry (method and environment, never the secret).
   Verify the person asking really is the client's admin before running it.
3. **Drivers** have no email: a supervisor or admin resets their PIN (*Drivers/Users > Reset credential*).

### Firebase console settings for sign-in emails

Do these once per project (staging and prod). The app only calls `sendPasswordResetEmail` and `sendEmailVerification`;
Firebase sends the mail.

- **Email enumeration protection**: *Authentication > Settings > User actions > Enable email enumeration protection*. With
  it on, Firebase Auth also stops answering "no such user" to the browser. (The app already shows the same confirmation
  for every address; this closes the same hole at the API.)
- **Authorized domains**: *Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains > Add domain* `app.convoypass.com` (and the
  staging domain). Without it the "continue" link in the emails is refused; the app then retries without it, but clients
  lose the link back to the login page.
- **Email action URL**: *Authentication > Templates > (Password reset, Email address verification) > pencil icon >
  Customize action URL* = `https://app.convoypass.com/auth/action`. The app's `/auth/action` page handles
  `resetPassword` and `verifyEmail`; every other mode is ignored. Set it for both templates.
- **Templates**: same screen. Set the sender name (for example `ConvoyPass`), the reply-to, the subject lines
  (for example "Reset your ConvoyPass password" and "Verify your email for ConvoyPass") and the language
  (English; the app has no translations yet).
- **Deliverability**: the default sender (`noreply@<project>.firebaseapp.com`) often lands in spam. Before launch, configure
  a **custom SMTP server or sender domain** (*Templates > SMTP settings*, or a custom sender domain) with **SPF and DKIM**
  (and DMARC) records for that domain, then send a reset email to Gmail, Outlook and a company mailbox and check the
  inbox. Until then tell clients to check their spam folder (the forgot-password page says so).

### Reading reset and verification links on the emulator

The Auth emulator sends no mail. It prints each link in the terminal running `npm run emulators`
(`To reset the password for x@y.z, follow this link: ...`) and lists all of them as JSON:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9099/emulator/v1/projects/<project-id>/oobCodes   # [{ email, requestType, oobCode, oobLink }, ...]
```

Open the app's own page with the code from there: `http://localhost:5173/auth/action?mode=resetPassword&oobCode=<code>` or
`...?mode=verifyEmail&oobCode=<code>`. (The printed `oobLink` goes to the emulator's built-in action page instead; both finish
the same reset.) `npm run admin:reset -- --env emulator --email ... --link` prints a link the same way.

`npm run verify:invite-access` (emulators running; under `firebase emulators:exec` set `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` to the `--project` you gave it) proves with a raw Admin SDK call and every client role that nobody can read or
write `setupInvites`.

## Backups and restore

Firestore holds everything that matters (passes, users, audit log, settings). Storage holds photos (see retention below).

**Enable once per project** (staging and prod):

```sh
# Daily backups kept 7 days, weekly kept 14 weeks
gcloud firestore backups schedules create --database='(default)' --recurrence=daily --retention=7d --project=PROJECT
gcloud firestore backups schedules create --database='(default)' --recurrence=weekly --day-of-week=SUNDAY --retention=14w --project=PROJECT
gcloud firestore backups schedules list --database='(default)' --project=PROJECT

# Point-in-time recovery (restore to any minute of the last 7 days)
gcloud firestore databases update --database='(default)' --enable-pitr --project=PROJECT
gcloud firestore databases describe --database='(default)' --project=PROJECT | grep -i pitr   # pointInTimeRecoveryEnablement: POINT_IN_TIME_RECOVERY_ENABLED
```

- [ ] staging: schedules listed, PITR enabled (date, who)
- [ ] prod: schedules listed, PITR enabled (date, who)

**Restore drill (do this in staging at least quarterly, and once before go-live).** A restore always goes into a
*new* database; the live one is never overwritten by the drill.

```sh
# 1. Pick a backup (or use PITR in step 1b)
gcloud firestore backups list --location=LOCATION --project=PROJECT
# 1a. Restore a backup into a new database
gcloud firestore databases restore --source-backup=projects/PROJECT/locations/LOCATION/backups/BACKUP_ID \
  --destination-database=restore-drill --project=PROJECT
# 1b. ...or clone the live database as it was at a moment (PITR; the time must be within the last 7 days, whole minutes)
gcloud firestore databases clone --source-database=projects/PROJECT/databases/'(default)' \
  --snapshot-time=2026-03-10T08:00:00Z --destination-database=restore-drill --project=PROJECT

# 2. Wait until it is READY
gcloud firestore databases describe --database=restore-drill --project=PROJECT | grep -E 'state|name'

# 3. Verify: document counts per collection against the live database (the script prints a table and exits 1 on a mismatch you did not expect)
npm run verify-restore -- --env staging --database restore-drill

# 4. Spot check in the console (Firestore > database restore-drill): a recent pass, a user, an audit entry.

# 5. Clean up
gcloud firestore databases delete --database=restore-drill --project=PROJECT
```

Expected: step 3 prints every collection (`tenants`, `users`, `contractors`, `vehicles`, `drivers`, `vehiclePlates`, `passes`, `gateEvents`, `auditLog`, `notifications`) with equal counts for a backup taken moments ago, and counts that differ only by the writes since the snapshot otherwise.

- [ ] staging drill passed on (date, who, backup id, time taken)

**Rehearsal that needs no cloud project** (tested in this repository, proves the data survives an export and import and that `verify-restore` detects loss):

```sh
npm run drill:restore        # starts the emulators, seeds demo data, exports, wipes, imports, verifies
```

**A real disaster** (data deleted or corrupted in production):

1. Stop the damage: ask people to stop using the app if needed ([incident checklist](#incident-checklist)); deploy deny-all rules if data is still being corrupted.
2. Restore a backup or PITR clone into a new database (steps 1 to 3 above, name it `restore-YYYYMMDD`).
3. Move the good data back. The app reads the `(default)` database, so export from the restored database and import into the live one. Import **overwrites documents with the same id and does not delete extra ones**; for a clean slate, delete the affected collections first (after a fresh backup):
   ```sh
   gcloud firestore export gs://PROJECT-restore/export-YYYYMMDD --database=restore-YYYYMMDD --collection-ids=passes,users,... --project=PROJECT
   gcloud firestore import gs://PROJECT-restore/export-YYYYMMDD --database='(default)' --project=PROJECT
   ```
   (create the bucket first, in the same location; the Firestore service agent needs `roles/storage.admin` on it).
4. Run `npm run verify-restore` against `(default)`, then re-enable access. Re-issue notifications are not needed (they expire after 30 days anyway).
5. Write the incident up (what, when, how much data, how long).

Authentication users are **not** in Firestore backups: they are recreated from the console export (`firebase auth:export users.json --project PROJECT`, run it weekly and keep the file somewhere private) or via *Users > Create user* in the app.

## TTL policies

Notifications expire 30 days after creation (`expireAt`) and rate-limit windows expire shortly after use. Firestore deletes expired documents for free once a TTL policy exists. This is a console or `gcloud` step, not code:

```sh
gcloud firestore fields ttls update expireAt --collection-group=notifications --enable-ttl --database='(default)' --project=PROJECT
gcloud firestore fields ttls update expireAt --collection-group=rateLimits --enable-ttl --database='(default)' --project=PROJECT
gcloud firestore fields ttls update expireAt --collection-group=pinAttempts --enable-ttl --database='(default)' --project=PROJECT
gcloud firestore fields ttls list --database='(default)' --project=PROJECT   # all three listed, state ACTIVE
```

Deletion happens within about 24 hours of expiry. Until the policy exists nothing is deleted, but nothing breaks: the app only reads the latest notifications.

## Evidence retention and Storage lifecycle

**In the app (default off).** *Admin > Settings > Evidence retention*: keep forever (default) or remove photos after
30 to 3650 days. `purgeOldEvidence` runs daily at 02:30 Colombo time. When a tenant sets a value, it deletes the Storage
folders of passes older than the limit (200 passes per run per tenant; a backlog clears over several nights), stamps
`evidenceDeletedAt` on the pass, and writes one audit entry (`evidence.purge`) per tenant and run. Pass documents and
their history are kept, and screens show *Evidence removed per retention policy*. **Deletion is permanent and cannot be
restored from a Firestore backup** (photos are in Storage, which has no backups here). Turning it on deletes photos that
are already past the limit: the admin sees a confirmation.

**Storage lifecycle (optional safety net).** Retention is per tenant and in the app; a bucket lifecycle rule is a blunt
global backstop. If you want one (for example "nothing older than 4 years, ever"), tenants share a prefix per tenant id,
so a rule matches `tenants/` as a whole:

```json
{ "rule": [ { "action": { "type": "Delete" }, "condition": { "age": 1460, "matchesPrefix": ["tenants/"] } } ] }
```
```sh
gcloud storage buckets update gs://PROJECT.appspot.com --lifecycle-file=lifecycle.json
gcloud storage buckets describe gs://PROJECT.appspot.com --format='default(lifecycle_config)'
```
Do not enable object versioning on the evidence bucket (deleted photos would linger). Driver photos live under the same prefix (`.../drivers/<uid>.jpg`) and are covered by the same rule: set the age longer than any retention you promise.

## App Check rollout

App Check (reCAPTCHA Enterprise) proves a request comes from the real web app. It is rolled out in four steps; **never
skip to enforcement**, because every installed phone must first be running a version that sends tokens.

1. **Create the key.** Google Cloud > reCAPTCHA Enterprise > *Create key* (Web, your domains incl. `localhost` for debug only if you want it). Firebase console > App Check > Apps > your web app > *reCAPTCHA Enterprise* > paste the key id.
2. **Ship the web app with the site key** (`VITE_APP_CHECK_SITE_KEY` as a GitHub environment variable), deploy. Do **not** set `ENFORCE_APP_CHECK` yet (leave `false`). The app now attaches tokens; nothing is rejected.
3. **Monitor.** Firebase console > App Check > each product (Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions) shows verified vs unverified requests. Wait at least a week and until unverified traffic is only expected sources (scripts, old cached app versions). Roll a release so old service-worker caches update.
4. **Enforce, one product at a time, staging first.**
   - Functions: set `ENFORCE_APP_CHECK=true` (GitHub environment variable → `functions/.env.<alias>`) and redeploy functions. Callables then reject requests without a valid token (`unauthenticated`). Check: `curl -s -X POST https://asia-south1-PROJECT.cloudfunctions.net/getDashboardTrend -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"data":{"days":7}}'` is rejected, while the app keeps working.
   - Firestore and Storage: console > App Check > *Enforce*. Immediate; reversible with *Unenforce*.

**Rollback** (any step): Firestore/Storage: *Unenforce* in the console (immediate). Functions: set `ENFORCE_APP_CHECK=false`, redeploy `--only functions`. Unenforcing never loses data.

**Debug tokens** (local development and CI): the emulators skip App Check. To run a real build against a real project from a laptop or a CI job, set `VITE_APP_CHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN=true`, open the app, copy the token printed in the browser console, and register it in console > App Check > Apps > *Manage debug tokens*. Then set `VITE_APP_CHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN=<that token>` (a secret in CI). The debug token is ignored in production builds. Revoke tokens you no longer use.

## Content Security Policy

`firebase.json` sends `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` (nothing is blocked). Browsers POST violations to `/csp-report`
(the `cspReport` function), which logs one line per violation: directive, blocked host and path, page path. View them in
Cloud Logging: `resource.type="cloud_run_revision" jsonPayload.fn="cspReport"`.

**Promote to enforcing** only after a full run in staging (every role, camera capture, photo upload, QR scan, sign-in, push opt-in) shows no violations for a few days:

```sh
npm run config:csp      # regenerates firebase.enforce-csp.json from firebase.json (one header renamed)
npx firebase deploy --only hosting --project staging --config firebase.enforce-csp.json
```

To make it permanent, rename the header in `firebase.json` (`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` → `Content-Security-Policy`) and delete `firebase.enforce-csp.json`. To go back, deploy with the default `firebase.json`. If a legitimate request is blocked, add its host to the right directive in `firebase.json`, run `npm run config:csp`, and redeploy.

The policy allows only the app's own origin, Firebase/Google APIs (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions, FCM, App Check), reCAPTCHA, `data:`/`blob:` images and camera canvases, and same-origin plus `blob:` workers. There are no Google Fonts, no inline scripts and no CDN code (image compression runs on the main thread for that reason).

## Warm instances (minimum instances) and cost

`checkIn`, `resolveVehicle` and `submitPass` are what people wait for at a gate or on a phone, so production keeps one instance warm
(`MIN_INSTANCES=1`); staging runs `0`. A warm instance is billed while idle (a reduced CPU rate plus memory, around the clock). At the default
256 MiB size that is roughly **USD 3 to 10 per function per month** depending on region pricing: three functions, about USD 10 to 30 a month.
Confirm in the [pricing calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator) for your region; set `MIN_INSTANCES=0` to remove the cost (cold starts then add
roughly 1 to 3 seconds to the first request after quiet periods). Change it in `functions/.env.prod` (or the GitHub environment variable) and redeploy functions.

## Push notifications

- Web push needs the VAPID key pair: Firebase console > Project settings > Cloud Messaging > Web Push certificates > *Generate key pair*; the public key is `VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY`.
- Notifications are created by Firestore triggers; pushes are data-only and drawn by the service worker. Approval pushes are collapsed per person (tag `pending-<role>-<contractor|tenant>`).
- **SLA reminders** run every 10 minutes (`slaReminders`) and need Cloud Scheduler. Locally they only run when you trigger them: `npm run sla:check`.
- Dead tokens are deleted automatically when FCM reports them unregistered or invalid. A failing push never fails a business call.
- iOS: web push works only for an installed web app (Add to Home Screen, iOS 16.4+). The app says so on iPhones and iPads.
- Logs: `jsonPayload.fn="onPassWritten"` (counts created, duplicates, pushed per event).

## Budget alerts and uptime check

**Budget** (Billing > Budgets & alerts, or):

```sh
gcloud billing budgets create --billing-account=BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID --display-name="ConvoyPass monthly" \
  --budget-amount=100USD --filter-projects=projects/PROJECT_NUMBER \
  --threshold-rule=percent=0.5 --threshold-rule=percent=0.9 --threshold-rule=percent=1.0
```
Add an email recipient (the project owner and a second person). Pick the amount from the first two months of real spend. A budget alerts, it does not stop spending.

**Uptime check** on the app URL (Cloud Monitoring > Uptime checks > *Create*): HTTPS, host = your domain, path `/`, every 5 minutes, from at least three regions, alert policy to email or chat after 2 failed checks. CLI (verify flags with `gcloud monitoring uptime create --help`):

```sh
gcloud monitoring uptime create convoypass-prod --resource-type=uptime-url \
  --resource-labels=host=app.example.com,project_id=PROJECT --protocol=https --path=/ --period=5 --project=PROJECT
```
The check proves hosting is up. For the backend, also alert on the log-based metric `severity=ERROR jsonPayload.outcome="error"` (every function logs `fn`, `outcome`, `uid`, `tenantId`).

- [ ] budget created · [ ] uptime check and alert policy created

## Incident checklist

1. **Decide the blast radius** and write the time down. Check the uptime check, Cloud Logging (`severity>=ERROR`), and the status of Firebase/Google Cloud.
2. **A contractor is involved** (stolen phones, ended contract): *Admin > Contractors > Suspend*. This revokes the sessions of every user of that contractor and blocks their callables immediately. Reactivate later with *Activate*.
3. **One person** (lost phone, leaver, suspected misuse): *Admin > Users > Disable*. It revokes their sessions. To end sessions without disabling (a password was shared): *Users > Reset credential* (also revokes).
4. **Revoke a token by hand** (when the app is not available): `node -e "require('firebase-admin').initializeApp({projectId:'PROJECT'});require('firebase-admin').auth().revokeRefreshTokens('UID').then(()=>console.log('revoked'))"` with `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` set. Note that an ID token already issued stays valid for up to an hour on Firestore reads; function calls re-check the account on every call.
5. **Bots or abuse**: confirm App Check enforcement ([rollout](#app-check-rollout)); the per-user rate limit already returns `resource-exhausted`. Look at `jsonPayload.outcome="rate-limited"`.
6. **Bad deploy**: [rollback](#rollback).
7. **Data damage**: [restore](#backups-and-restore).
8. **Hard stop**: deploy deny-all rules (`rules_version='2'; service cloud.firestore { match /databases/{d}/documents { match /{x=**} { allow read, write: if false; } } }`) with `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`, then restore the previous rules from git.
9. **After**: audit log (`/admin/audit`) for who did what, a short written timeline, and one improvement.

## GitHub setup

Repository **Settings > Environments**: create `staging` and `production`. On `production` add **Required reviewers** (the manual approval) and optionally a wait timer and a branch/tag rule (`v*`).
Per environment add:

| Kind | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Secret | `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | JSON key of a deployment service account for that project |
| Variables | `FUNCTIONS_REGION`, `APP_BASE_URL`, `ENFORCE_APP_CHECK`, `MIN_INSTANCES` | see [Environments](#environments) |
| Variables | `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`, `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`, `VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY`, `VITE_APP_CHECK_SITE_KEY` | public web config, not secrets |

**Deployment service account**: create one per project with the roles *Firebase Admin* is too broad; use *Cloud Functions Admin*, *Firebase Rules Admin*, *Firebase Hosting Admin*, *Cloud Datastore Index Admin* (`roles/datastore.indexAdmin`), *Service Account User*, *Artifact Registry Writer*, *Cloud Build Editor*, *Cloud Scheduler Admin*, *Eventarc Admin*, *Storage Admin* on the project as needed by your first deploy errors.

> **Workload identity federation is preferable to a stored key.** A JSON key is a long-lived secret that can leak and must be rotated by hand.
> With [Workload Identity Federation](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#workload-identity-federation-through-a-service-account),
> GitHub Actions exchange their short-lived OIDC token for Google credentials and no key is stored. To switch: create a pool and provider for the repository,
> grant it the roles above, give the workflow `permissions: id-token: write`, and replace `credentials_json` in `.github/actions/deploy/action.yml` with
> `workload_identity_provider` and `service_account`. Until then keep the key in an environment secret, rotate it every 90 days, and delete it when you migrate.
